# Zoo Management System

This project is a simple Zoo Management System designed to practice fundamental Java concepts and utilities. The application simulates basic zoo operations, such as managing animals, and food, while leveraging a variety of Java functionalities and technologies.

## Features:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implements core OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model real-world zoo entities.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust error management with custom exceptions for smoother runtime experiences.
- **Data Structures:** Efficient handling of data using collections (e.g., lists, sets, and maps).
- **Genericity:** Utilizes Java generics for type-safe operations.
- **Serialization:** Supports object and file serialization to persist zoo data and states.
- **Database Connectivity:** Integrates with a relational database to manage zoo records using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
- **UI with JavaFX:** Provides an intuitive graphical user interface built with JavaFX for better user interaction and experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java SE:** Core utilities and libraries for OOP, data handling, and exception management.
- **JavaFX:** For building a modern user interface.
- **JDBC:** To connect and interact with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- **Serialization:** Object/file serialization for data persistence.
